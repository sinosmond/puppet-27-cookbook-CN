[[about_author]]
== 关于作者

**John Arundel** is a consultant engineer who helps people build better infrastructure. He
uses automation and configuration management to make computer systems cheaper, faster,
and more reliable. Formerly a senior enterprise systems engineer in the hosting division of
US telco Verizon, he now runs his own company, Bitfield Consulting, and says he has never
worked so hard in his life, or for less money.

Over the years John has worked with clients in the advertising and media industry, software,
finance, retail, logistics, and even the emergency services, advising on architecture,
automation, security, backups, resilience, performance, capacity planning, and regulatory
compliance. He has been a member of the Puppet community since its earliest days, and
organizes regular local sysadmin meetups and social events.

John holds a B.Sc.(Hons) in Computer Science, with a research interest in kernel resource
scheduler design, and is a certified Sun Solaris administrator, LPI (Linux Professional Institute)
graduate, and a member of the British Computer Society (MBCS). He is security-cleared to work
on computer systems for the UK nuclear industry, which is probably nothing to worry about.

He has also worked as a software developer, both professionally and for the fun of it,
contributing to several open source projects, and building a high-performance research chess
engine. He blogs regularly at http://bitfieldconsulting.com on Puppet and system
administration topics, is usually to be found on Twitter (@bitfield) complaining about
things, and often speaks at technical user groups and conferences.

In his negligible spare time, John enjoys repairing Land Rovers, playing Go, and barbecuing.
He lives in London and Cornwall.

often helped out when things didn't work the way they were supposed to,
which was virtually all the time.
