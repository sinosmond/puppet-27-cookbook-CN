=== 本书内容

Chapter 1, Puppet Infrastructure introduces some key techniques for managing your
Puppet server and manifests, including version control, automated deployment, file
serving, pre-signing and autosigning certificates, scaling with Passenger, and a distributed
decentralized Puppet architecture using Git.

Chapter 2, Monitoring, Reporting, and Troubleshooting covers ways that Puppet can report
information about what it's doing, and the status of your systems. This includes graphical and
e-mail reports, log and debug messages, dependency graphing, testing and dry-running your
manifests, using tags, run stages, and environments, and a guide to some of Puppet's more
common error messages.

Chapter 3, Puppet Language and Style will show you examples of good programming style
in Puppet and language constructs that can help you keep your code concise and readable,
including conditionals, selectors, case statements, arrays, and regular expressions.

Chapter 4, Writing Better Manifests takes you through structuring your Puppet manifests
using node and class inheritance, resource dependencies, and parameterized classes.
You'll also see how to get data in and out of Puppet from the environment using CSV files
and shell scripts.

Chapter 5, Working with Files and Packages covers powerful techniques for managing
config files, including ERB templates, generating files from snippets, and using the Augeas
tool. You'll also see how to use Puppet to install packages from APT repositories, and how
to set up your own APT and Gem repositories.

Chapter 6, Users and Virtual Resources explains how virtual resources can help you manage
different combinations of users and packages on different machines, and shows you how to
use Puppet's resource scheduling and auditing features.

Chapter 7, Applications focuses on some specific applications that you may need to manage
with Puppet, including complete recipes for Apache and Nginx, MySQL, Drupal, and Rails.

Chapter 8, Servers and Cloud Infrastructure extends the power of Puppet to managing
virtual machines, both in the cloud and on your desktop, with recipes for Vagrant and EC2
instances. It also shows you how to set up a Nagios monitoring server, load balancing with
HAProxy, firewalls with iptables, network filesystems with NFS, and high-availability
services with Heartbeat.

Chapter 9, External Tools and the Puppet Ecosystem looks at the tools that have grown
up around Puppet and help you integrate it with the rest of your network, including Puppet
Dashboard, Foreman, and MCollective. It also introduces you to some advanced topics
including writing your own resource types, providers, and external node classifiers.

=== 阅读前提

要运行这本书中的例子，你需要一台安装了 Ubuntu Linux 10.04 的电脑，安装 Puppet 并与互联网连接。

虽然不是绝对必要的，但我还是建议准备一台咖啡机或其他形式的含咖啡因的饮料机。

=== 适用读者

本书假定你已经安装过 Puppet，或许已经写过一些基本的配置清单或适于发布的模块。
同时需要一些 Linux 系统的管理经验，包括熟悉的命令行、文件系统和文本编辑等。
但没有编程经验的要求。

=== 格式约定

在这本书中，你会发现一些不同的文本样式以区分不同种类的信息。这里是一些样式的例子及其含义。

正文中的代码样式举例；“你需要一台 Puppetmaster 以及 ++/etc/puppet++ 目录下的一些已存在的配置清单。”

一个代码块的样式举例：

[source,bash]
----
  #!/bin/sh
  
  syntax_errors=0
  error_msg=$(mktemp /tmp/error_msg.XXXXXX)
  
  if git rev-parse --quiet --verify HEAD > /dev/null
  then
      against=HEAD
  fi
----

一个命令行输入或输出的样式举例：

..........
# puppet parser validate/etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp
err: Could not parse for environment production: Syntax error at end
of file at /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp:3
..........

**新术语**和**重要文字** 以粗体显示。你在屏幕上看到的文字，例如在菜单或对话框中出现的文字样式举例：
“单击 *Next* 按钮进入下一个屏幕”。

[NOTE]

警告或重要信息的样式。
